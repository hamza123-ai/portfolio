            <h3>Test Taking Application(Currently working on it)</h3>
            <p>A Test-Taking Application is an online platform designed to facilitate the creation, administration, and evaluation of exams. It allows users to take tests remotely, with features like automated grading, real-time feedback, and detailed performance analytics. The platform supports multiple question formats (e.g., multiple-choice, short answer, essay) and ensures secure testing through proctoring and randomization. It's accessible across devices and supports user roles such as students, instructors, and admins.
                Skills used in the project include web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend development (using frameworks like Spring Boot for creating APIs), database management (SQL for storing user data and test results), and security implementation (Spring Security for authentication and authorization). Additionally, integration of real-time features and creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces require expertise in frontend and backend technologies.</p>
